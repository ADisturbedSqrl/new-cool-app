# New Cool App - Git Pull Request Exercise

Your task is as follows:

1. Fork this repo to create a copy under your user.
2. Clone the repo to your machine.
3. Create a feature branch off the `development` branch with the naming format `feature/<your_name>`.
4. Add your name and food to the lists in `app.py`.
5. Create a pull request with the following branch configuration:
    - Base repository: `htr-volker/<your_team>`, base: `development`.
    - Head repository: `<your_username>/<your_team>`, compare: `feature/<your_name>`.
6. Resolve any merge requests.
7. Inform me (Harry) and I'll merge your new change into `main`!

Team who gets all their names and foods merged into their team's main repo wins!

*NB: there are no prizes.*
